# Knowledge-base architecture

How this repo is organized as the operating substrate for a long-lived, autonomous agent
(and its humans). Everything is plain **markdown + frontmatter in git** — diffable, reviewable,
agent-writable. This doc is the durable record of the model so the shape stays intentional as
it grows.

**Product:** Anvilry — personal portfolio + AI-powered developer showcase (Next.js 16). The `View` union has six members (`classic`, `gamified`, `chat`, `developer`, `voice`, `resume`); the switcher shows four pills server-side and five on desktop after hydration. See `CLAUDE.md` → "The View System".

## The model (v1 — deliberately minimal)

Two ideas only:

1. **Artifacts** are global, foldered by **kind**; `domain:` is a **field (a list)**, not a folder.
   Each artifact has exactly one home (by *what it is*). Cross-cutting is handled by tags + links
   — never by duplicating or by nesting inside a domain.
2. **Domains** are "loops" — a thread of work with a charter, cadence, and metrics. A domain
   folder holds only its **README (charter)** + **machinery** (metrics, collectors). It **links**
   artifacts; it never contains them.

### Kinds (start with just these two)

| kind | what it is | folder | key frontmatter |
|---|---|---|---|
| `signal` | evidence: feedback / idea / observation (deduped, frequency-counted) | `signals/` | `category, frequency, sources[], domain[], status` |
| `doc` | durable knowledge: an analysis, a decision, a thing you learned | `docs/` | `domain[], status?, links` |

Each folder's `README` is its schema — read it before adding artifacts of that kind.
A loop's to-dos live inline as a backlog in its domain `README`. Promote them to a `task`
kind only once you've earned it.

### Earning a new kind

Default to an existing kind. Add a new one **only** when it has all three of: its own status
machine **AND** queryable frontmatter fields **AND** a distinct body shape. Otherwise it's a
`doc` or a `signal` with a tag, or a backlog line in a domain README.

## Domains (active loops)

| Domain | Goal | Cadence | Collector |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| `content` | Keep the portfolio content fresh, consistent, and discoverable | weekly | MDX files + Velite output |
| `seo` | Maximize organic reach via llms.txt, structured data, sitemap, and canonical URLs | weekly | Vercel Analytics + Google Search Console |
| `performance` | Keep Core Web Vitals green; catch bundle regressions before they ship | on PR | `pnpm build` bundle analysis + web-vitals |

## Key invariants

- **Never fabricate metrics.** The `register` field on Work MDX items is the canonical attribution source.
- **Bijection guard.** `game-model.test.ts` asserts every graph node maps to real content — it blocks deploys if orphaned.
- **`.velite/` is gitignored.** Always run `pnpm content` before type-checking or testing.
- **Secrets via env.** No hardcoded keys. Use `vercel env pull .env.local` for local dev.
- **Feature flags.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars gate experimental features (GRAPH_PHYSICS, MULTIMODAL_ATTACHMENTS, PDF_ATTACHMENTS, EXTENDED_THINKING).
